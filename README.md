NodeApp: write Desktop apps in Node.js
======================================

NodeApp is a framework extracted from [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) to build native Mac and Windows entirely in Node.js (with a possible splash of platform-specific native code for the UI).

Work in progress; the framework will mature together with Node.js-based version of LiveReload.


Native app requirements
-----------------------

The native app must supply the following files included by the framework:

* `app_config.h`
* `app_version.h`
* `nodeapp_rpc_routing.h`, `nodeapp_rpc_routing.c`, `nodeapp_rpc_proxy.c`, automatically generated by `rake routing` task defined in `nodeapp/core/tasks/routing.rb`

The app's Rakefile is supposed to include `nodeapp/*/tasks/*.rb`.
